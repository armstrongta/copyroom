# Implementation Instructions:

* Clone into the Repo
* Open and run the recreate.py and my_theme.py files in your IDE.
* find a jpeg of your school logo, save it in the "assets" folder with the name "school_logo"
* Close out of your IDE, navigate to and open your new "stock.xlsx"
* Following the formatting provided, fill in the appropriate information in every sheet excluding "checkouts". And leave Steve Rogers in the "person_dict" sheet as a place holder. Don't worry, he'll never make it into the books. Feel free to try and submit something with his name ;)
* Once you've finished, save/close "stock.xlsx", and in your IDE run the app!
