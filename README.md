# Implementation Instructions:

* Clone into the Repo
* Open and run the recreate.py file in your IDE
* Close out of your IDE, navigate to and open your new "stock.xlsx"
* Following the formatting provided, fill in the appropriate information in every sheet excluding "checkouts". And leave Steve Rogers in the "person_dict" sheet as a place holder. Don't worry, he'll never make it into the books. Feel free to try and submit something with his name ;)
* Once you've finished, save/close "stock.xlsx", and in your IDE run the app!

##### How to run the app:

First time:

1. Click Run triangle at the top, then copy run statement from the top of the terminal
2. Paste that somewhere and delete "--reload --autoreload-port 58598"
3. Save the Run Statement at the top of the app.py file (with a "#" in front of it making it a comment)
4. then...

Every time after that:

1. Paste the Run Statement from after the "#" into the terminal, hit enter
2. Follow the uvicorn link with that it prints out
